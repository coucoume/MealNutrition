MealNutrition
=============

It's an Android project, it uses in my opinion the main features that Android have. It is the first version of an application that was published after and the idea was to let you track the way you eat, allowing you to take pictures of the meal and display them in a list.
It's a very raw implementation but gives a good idea of many interest concepts.

This is a list of the features you can find in the code:
- Activities
- Fragments
- Intents used to take a picture
- MySQL-lite Data bases access
- UI Components
  - ListView
  - Buttons
  - ImageView
- Image Async. loading
- Retrieving images from a Cache
- Support for old Android versions
